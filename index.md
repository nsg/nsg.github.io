# About Me

I'm a system administrator that works in the devops-spectrum of the trade. I works down at the metal with servers, network and whatever solves my problem. I work with the software stack building clusters, container management and crazy contraptions. I also do some development as well from time to time.

Love to thinker with code, over the last years I have mostly been fascinated with LXD, Snapcraft, Docker, High Availability, Clusters, Automation and I'm trying to learn to program the GPU (OpenGL). I have been working with everything from tiny tings up to large clusters in data centers.
