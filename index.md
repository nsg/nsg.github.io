# About Me

I'm a system administrator that works in the devops-spectrum of the trade. I work with servers and whatever solves my problem. I work with the software stack building clusters, container management and crazy contraptions. From time to time, I also do some development.

I Love to thinker with code and tweak systems. Over the last years I have mostly been fascinated with LXD, Snapcraft, Ansible, Docker, High Availability, Clusters, Automation and I'm trying to learn to program the GPU (OpenGL). I have been working with everything from tiny tings up to large clusters in data centers.
